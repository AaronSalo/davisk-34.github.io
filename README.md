## Hosting your resume on Github Pages <br/> and learn principles of good technical communication along the way

Github Pages is a great way to host a resume or simple website. It's cost-free, ad-free, and very easy to use. In this readme I will explain the steps to hosting your resume with Github Pages. I will also explain a few principles of good technical communication.

### Step 1: Create/Log-in to you Github account
Create Github account, if you don't have one already. It is a simple process, just like signing up for any other site.

### Step 2: Create a new repository called [username].github.io
Click !["New"](images/new.png) to create a new repository.
The repository's name MUST be [username].github.io.
This creates a special repo that contains a Github Page.<br/>
!["New"](images/repoName.gif)<br/>
Then, click "Create Repository" at the bottom of the page.

### Step 3: Create a new file called "index.md"
Once the repo is made, you will be sent to a Quick Setup page. Click on !["Creating a new file"](images/creatingANewFile.png) and name the file "index.md". This is a markdown file that will be displayed when you visit [username].github.io from a web browser. It works exactly like an index.html, except is it a markdown file.

### Step 4: Pick a Jekyll theme
